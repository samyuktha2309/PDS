There is no significant difference between male and female students in reading scores, with similar medians and interquartile ranges. A positive correlation exists between math and reading scores, as students performing well in one subject tend to do well in the other. Higher parental education is associated with better writing scores, possibly due to greater access to educational resources. Students who completed a test preparation course have significantly higher writing scores, underscoring the course's benefits.
